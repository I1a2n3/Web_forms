# Databases

- I have created two databases: 
    - `User`
    - `Product`
- You will need the following extensions:
    - `flask-migrate`
    - `flask-sqlalchemy`
- To apply changes to your database you will run the following three commands:
    - `flask db init`
    - `flask db migrate -m 'message'`
    - `flask db upgrade`
